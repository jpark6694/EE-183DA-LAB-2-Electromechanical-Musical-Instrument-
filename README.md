# This is the second lab of my EE 183DA design course (Robotic System Design). We are required to build an electromechanical musical instrument driven by a ESP8266 microcontroller with WiFi-imported features. This instrument has to have both autonomous and human-controlled operation modes. It will also be commanded via an internet-based web interface. For my design, I created a simplified drum that is programmed to follow a musical piece with a set of different beats. The following beats include quarter notes, half notes, and whole notes. The user is able to create a musical piece of their choice with HTTP using their mobile phones or other internet devices. My focus on this design were mainly on the use of servos and the use of internet of things.
